==========

**htb-write-ups-bot** â€” is a proof-of-concept [Telegram bot](https://t.me/HTBWriteUpsBot) that allows you to search through retired [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/ "Hack The Box :: Penetration Testing Labs") machines for write-ups. It is based on the official YouTube API module for Python (for looting the [@ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA)'s YT blog) and bs4 HTML parsing module (for looting the [@0xdf](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/)'s blog).

Inspired by [get_ippsec_details.py](https://gist.github.com/sminez/571bd7bafb1b88630b85c85a0cd66e3a "Find examples of pen testing methods and tools in videos by Ippsec (as of 26th June 2019)").
